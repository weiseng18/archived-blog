The idea of starting my own technical blog has been lurking at the back of my mind for a while.

With my 2 years in National Service only ending just 4 days ago, as well as having inspirations for other personal projects (thus prioritizing them), the idea of starting my own technical blog has only stayed as an idea.

Today marks the day that this idea materializes into something tangible.

## What does this blog mean to me?

Keeping a blog has many benefits, of which these are more important to me:

1. Provides opportunities to improve my writing skills
	- This blog can be viewed by anyone, and as such I should subconsciously take extra care and effort in writing
	- Because it can be viewed by anyone, I need to ensure that my writing is understandable and succinct
	- Every post is a new opportunity to learn and improve
2. Great overview of my progress
	- Apart from improving my writing skills, having a collection of write-ups/content provides yet another way to observe how I change.
3. Consolidation of my work
	- This site will serve as an area for myself to consolidate my work.

## Deciding on the framework

{:.mainidea}
In any programming project, it is up to yourself to decide if you want to do up everything from scratch, or if you want to make use of existing solutions, and value add to them.

When the idea of starting my own technical blog was still in its infancy, I was excited to write everything from scratch. I was planning to have some content files, and some scripts to convert the content files into HTML files. There would be tags in the content files so that I can specify what kind of HTML file I want to generate. Although it would be daunting, I was sure that I would enjoy the process. Additionally, writing everything on my own would mean that I know exactly how everything works, so I would be able to customize as much as I needed.

However, sometimes it isn't necessary to re-invent the wheel.

Just before starting this blog, I found a [technical blog](https://fanpu.io/) maintained by my senior which is created through [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll). After reading up about Jekyll and asking him about it, I realized that Jekyll would provide everything that I should need, and the only "drawback" would be having to learn how to use Jekyll, which ended up being not difficult at all.

Ultimately, I decided to use Jekyll, based on my original main reasons for starting this blog. I want to focus more on writing content - and using Jekyll would allow me to spend more time on writing content. Anyway, in a career in the field of computer science, one's ability to re-use code is as important as their ability to write new code - but that would be another discussion for another day.
