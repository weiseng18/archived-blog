I am Tan Wei Seng, from Singapore. I'm an incoming undergraduate at [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/), majoring in [Computer Science](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/programmes/ug/cs/).

I started this blog on 15 February 2021, and it is built using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
