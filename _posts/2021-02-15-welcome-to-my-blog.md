The idea of starting my own technical blog has been lurking at the back of my mind for a while.

With my 2 years in National Service only ending just 4 days ago, as well as having inspirations for other personal projects (thus prioritizing them), the idea of starting my own technical blog has only stayed as an idea.

Today marks the day that this idea materializes into something tangible.

## What does this blog mean to me?

Keeping a blog has many benefits, of which these are more important to me:

1. Provides opportunities to improve my writing skills
	- This blog can be viewed by anyone, and as such I should subconsciously take extra care and effort in writing
	- Because it can be viewed by anyone, I need to ensure that my writing is understandable and succinct
	- Every post is a new opportunity to learn and improve
2. Great overview of my progress
	- Apart from improving my writing skills, having a collection of write-ups/content provides yet another way to observe how I change.
3. Consolidation of my work
	- This site will serve as an area for myself to consolidate my work.
